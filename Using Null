1.
List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
Why we cannot use =
You might think that the phrase dept=NULL would work here but it doesn't - you can use the phrase dept IS NULL
That's not a proper explanation.
No it's not, but you can read a better explanation at Wikipedia:NULL.

SELECT name FROM teacher WHERE dept IS NULL;

2.
Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);
           
3.
Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher LEFT OUTER JOIN dept 
  ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);
  
  4.
Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher RIGHT OUTER JOIN dept 
  ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);
  
  5.
Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

SELECT name,
COALESCE (mobile, '07986 444 2266')
FROM teacher;

OR

SELECT name,
CASE 
WHEN mobile IS NULL THEN '07986 444 2266' 
ELSE mobile 
END as mobile
FROM teacher;
